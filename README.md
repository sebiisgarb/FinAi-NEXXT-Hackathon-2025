## 🚀 About the Project

FinAI was developed during the **NEXXT AI Hackathon 2025** by team **Skepya**, to tackle one of the biggest challenges in modern finance:

> 💬 *Banks provide data, but not direction.*  
> Users get hundreds of charts, products, and reports, but no clear guidance on what actually fits their real-life goals.

## 🧩 The Problem

1. **Information Overload** – Customers receive too much financial data and too few actionable conclusions.  
2. **Lack of Personalization** – Current systems offer generic recommendations that don’t take the individual risk profile into account.  
3. **Missed Growth Opportunities** – Without guidance, users stay passive and banks lose potential revenue.
