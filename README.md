## 🚀 About the Project

FinAI was developed during the **NEXXT AI Hackathon 2025** by team **Skepya**, to address one of the biggest challenges in modern finance:

> 💬 *Banks provide data, but not direction.*  
> Users receive hundreds of charts, products, and reports, but no clear guidance on what actually fits their real goals.

## 🧩 The Problem

1. **Information Overload** – Customers receive too much financial data and too few actionable insights.  
2. **Lack of Personalization** – Current systems offer generic recommendations that ignore the individual risk profile.  
3. **Missed Growth Opportunities** – Without guidance, users remain passive and banks lose potential revenue.

FinAI combines **intelligent profiling**, **dynamic recommendations**, and an **AI conversational assistant** to deliver personalized financial experiences.
